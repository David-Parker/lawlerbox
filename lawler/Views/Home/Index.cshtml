            My second internship. This time in Redmond, WA. At Microsoft I was part of the Data and Analytics team. I was
            responsible for creating a data reprocessing tool for an internal workflow program that runs on a map-reduce framework.
            I worked on both back end and front end code at Microsoft. I Created a library in C# that integrated my team's service
            with code that calls into the map-reduce framework. Once that API was created, I worked in ASP .Net with our Web UI to create
            a user friendly and easy to use dashboard that enables developers to reprocess data from their jobs. Interning at Microsoft is 
            like nothing else on the planet.

            My first internship in Austin, TX. National Instruments is a company about creating tools and devices for engineers and scientists.
            Here I created drivers for scientific instruments in LabView and in C. The basic development process was as follow. Customer has some proprietary hardware
            -> Asks NI for a driver -> Sends a manual / instrument to our team -> I learned the ins and outs of the hardware -> Created the API the customer
            would use to program the instrument in LabVIEW. However, that was not the most enriching part of my experience. I had an idea for a tool that would 
            significantly reduce development times!

            Marble Mania is a 3D marble game where the player's goal is to traverse the obstacles and enter the warp portal. This game was a solo development starting my first year in college
            and rolled over into my summer. I developed all the content, code and design for the game and published it in major Android marketplaces.
